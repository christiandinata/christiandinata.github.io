							<p>Some of us might not realize that being productive in this pandemic season could be done in various kind of ways, not only from doing your works or certain activities but, the answer is Hobby. Pursue your hobby to achieve what you have been dreaming about or even to find your hidden passion, I’d say “Why not?”. You might find yourself comfortable on doing something and happy to see the outcome, so let’s start our journey now. <span class="read_more_button">Read more</span></p>
							<div class="hidden">
								<center><h2 class="solid">Being Productive During Pandemic Season</h2></center>
								<p>Speaking about being productive, many people on social media or real life often talk about having concern on feeling different or not usual like they used to do before the COVID-19 pandemic season. Those who used to be a workaholic person or tend to go to mall, concert, and outdoor activities would feel bored, uncomfortable, hard to resist to go outside or even less productive. Therefore, I would like to talk a bit about how unbelievably hobby will keep you being productive.</p>
								<p>What do you know about productiveness? It is simple though different meanings depend on how an individual interprets it. Personally, productiveness for me is the capability of someone to work on something positive to produce an expected result that leads to character improvement. I know you have been thinking about another meaning but, let’s move forward. Hobby is something that everyone has eventually. It’s something that everyone does because they love it, they feel happy when doing it, and they spend their time on it. So, it’s clear that you could still being productive even when you are locked down by doing your hobbies, pursue it towards your goal and you will achieve something in return of course your hobby should be the positive one.</p>
								<p>Let me tell you a bit about my hobbies, just a brief sharing, I love to read books, do a research about anything that related to my current condition, and I also love to write anything. Hence, you are here at my personal blog. Let us take a brief look, reading books will give you more knowledge and sometimes it gives you peace but it depends on the genre. Research is an easy to do thing, it also gives you some important information, you know that information could be delivered from internet, friends, books, or even social media. I used to do a research about some factors that caused me felt dizzy when I just woke up and it’s no joke but really helpful. I managed to improve my life style and focus more on my health thanks for the information. Writing is extremely helpful for you to pour out anything in your mind or express how you feel. By writing we could also advance to the next level like create a blog, publish it to the internet and maybe you might not realize it but we somehow have helped people with our writings.</p>
								<p>How was it? Lot of possible experiences you could get if you start only from your hobbies. You will feel like being productive by doing your hobbies as what I’m feeling right now, you will get a positive outcome and of course it wlll change your character into the better one.
								</p>
								<center><h2 class="solid">Refreshing Is Not Always Your Hobby</h2></center>
								<p>Sometimes when teens were asked about their hobbies, they often said things they usually do everyday and most of the time. Sleep, play mobile games, watch TV, or etc, those are refreshing activities and personally I don’t think those are qualified as hobbies. Refreshing activities is not always your hobbies and if you probably still disagree with that, let’s move forward though I’m just trying to pour out my opinions.</p>
								<p>Some of us as a teenagers often spend most of our time only with refreshing. I take teens as an example because they are in the most prominent period to grow, to be creative, and have lot of wild ideas. What you get after refreshing is obvious, you will feel relieved, you will feel at ease but what are you going to get after persuing your hobbies? I believe it’s something bigger than you expected. Therefore, for some of you that used to have your hobbies back before this COVID-19 pandemic season, I advise you to find an alternative way. For instance, you are a person that loves to learn new stuff and interact with people, so there are lot of alternatives for that like doing a research, browsing, find an educative webinar, start online courses, etc. </p>
								<p>Hence, there is a slight difference between refreshing and hobby but a huge difference speaking of the outcome. Every single thing that you do everyday will decide what you will get eventually. Have some refreshing is not prohibited, but I’d say start with your hobbies as those will be more sustainable during this pandemic season.
								</p>
								<center><h2 class="solid">Positive Hobbies Create An Opportunity</h2></center>
								<p>Speaking about a new normal, meaning a new way of living, going to work, and interacting with people, there is also an alternative way to create such an opportunity and it’s from your hobbies. Opportunity here means to create something helpful for people or to achieve a certain goal based on what you are proposing right now.</p>
								<p>I’d like to share a bit about myself first. I love to read books and write anything like essay or blog or even a piece that I used to confide to myself. I realized that by pursuing my hobbies, I would be able to create an opportunity to publish my writings, to entertain people, and hopefully to give an englightenment. More about my hobbies, I think I have told you at above but I love to do some research, it helps me to find something that I didn’t even realize that it was my passion and it was to create a website. You find yourself comfortable on sketching, maybe you will be able to paint a big picture with deep meaning and publish it, who knows and why not, right?</p>
								<p>So, what I really wanted to say at this part is find your hobby if you don’t have one then start to pursue it. You will never know what you will get but I believe if your hobby is a positive one, then you will get something positive in return eventually. We can’t stay like the same as before the pandemic season and importantly we can’t go back to what our life used to be. Look forward, use this moment as your opportunity to create something that will be helpful for others and best if it’s adaptable. It’s simple, just start with your hobbies.
								</p>
								<p>It’s not always too late to start with your hobby. You love to do something and when you pursue it, make sure you are in the state that you deserve something bigger. </p>
